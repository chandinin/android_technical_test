# Samsao's Reporter

Your mission, if you accept it, is to list all public repositories of the
Samsao's organization on Github.

For this task, your objective is to create a screen containing, in a list
form, all the Samsao's public repositories on Github. Each row must display
the repository full name and last update time.

Each row must be clickable, and once clicked, it must display a small
dialog containing the following information:

 * Language
 * Default branch
 * Forks count

The dialog must have only an "OK" button that dismisses the dialog.

## Guidelines

Write the code to be production-grade. You are free to use whether library
you want.
